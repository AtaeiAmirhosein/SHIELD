USAGE: @G{shield} delete-tenant @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Delete a SHIELD Tenant.

  Each SHIELD Core defines one or more tenants, each with their own
  set of cloud storage configurations, data systems, and backup jobs.

  When you delete a tenant, all of its private storage systems, data
  systems, jobs, and archives will be removed from the database.

  @Y{NOTE:} This command is only available to @R{SHIELD Site Managers}.
