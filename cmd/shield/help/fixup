USAGE: @G{shield} fixup @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  Display more detail about a single SHIELD Data Fixup.

  From time to time, we fix bugs in SHIELD, and the fixes need to
  retroactively update existing data that may have been munged or
  corrupted by previously buggy versions of SHIELD.  These fixes
  are called "Data Fixups".
