USAGE: @G{shield} apply-fixup @Y{NAME-OR-UUID}

  (Re-)Apply a SHIELD Data Fixup.

  From time to time, we fix bugs in SHIELD, and the fixes need to
  retroactively update existing data that may have been munged or
  corrupted by previously buggy versions of SHIELD.  These fixes
  are called "Data Fixups".

  Data Fixups run normally, when the SHIELD Core boots up, but
  only if that particular fixup has not already been applied
  (SHIELD keeps track).  This command lets you force a re-run.
